# David William Crego - Personal Academic Website

This is your personal academic website based on the design of leoregalado.com.

## Files Included

- **index.html** - Home page with bio, research interests, and education
- **research.html** - Publications and working papers
- **teaching.html** - Teaching experience
- **presentations.html** - Conference presentations
- **cv.html** - Comprehensive CV
- **README.md** - This file

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Add Your Profile Photo
- Add a file named `profile.jpg` in the same directory as the HTML files
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels (square)
- The image should be a professional headshot

### 2. Update GitHub and LinkedIn Links
In `index.html`, find these lines and replace the `#` with your actual URLs:
```html
<a href="#" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
<a href="#" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
```

For example:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
```

### 3. Hosting Your Website

You have several options for hosting:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Free & Easy)
1. Create a GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io`
2. Upload all HTML files and your profile photo to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`

#### Option B: Custom Domain (like your friend's leoregalado.com)
1. Purchase a domain name from providers like:
   - Namecheap
   - Google Domains
   - GoDaddy
2. Use hosting services like:
   - GitHub Pages (with custom domain)
   - Netlify (free tier available)
   - Vercel (free tier available)
3. Upload your files and configure your domain settings

#### Option C: University Web Space
Many universities provide free web hosting for students and faculty. Check with Texas Tech's IT department.

### 4. Future Updates

To add new publications, presentations, or teaching experience:
1. Open the relevant HTML file (research.html, presentations.html, teaching.html)
2. Copy the structure of an existing item
3. Update the text with your new information
4. Save and re-upload to your hosting service

## Design Notes

- The website uses a clean, minimalist design matching your friend's site
