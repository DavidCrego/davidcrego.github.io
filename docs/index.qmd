I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University and a Research Assistant at the Free Market Institute. I also serve as a Graduate Instructor in the Area of Energy Commerce & Business Economics at the Rawls College of Business.

My research focuses on economics of religion and historical political economy with an emphasis on how institutions and economic incentives influence individual behavior and collective governance. More broadly, my work seeks to understand how institutional changes resolve governance problems and create allocative efficiencies.
